# Setting Up the Frontend
1. Start by installing NodeJS for your system. Information on how to do so can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).
2. Check that Node was successfully installed
```
$ node -v
```
3. From the root project directory, change directory into the UI directory.
```
$ cd quest_keyer_ui
```
4. Run npm install to download all of the frontend project dependencies
```
$ npm install
```
5. Test that the frontend UI application runs
```
$ npm start run
```
Congrats! The frontend is now setup and ready for development.
